How to use betScraper
=======

This page will describe how to use `betScrapeR`. I will try to explain each step in detail, though some previous knowledge of R is required. If you've never used R before, you can download it [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/). Following that, I'd recommend installing [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), an integrated development environment (IDE) that is much more intuitive and efficient than the base R version.

## Before We start

If you've already succesfully installed `betScraper` and the [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) package, you can skip this section.

Okay, so we have R installed on our computer. We're going to download `betScrapeR` directly from our R console. The ability to do so relies on a package called `devtools`. We'll first need to install that, by running this code:

```r
# code preceded by a hash symbol is a comment
install.packages("devtools")
```

If that worked, we can install `betScrapeR` with either of the following codes:

```r
# install from Gitlab
devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/dashee87/betScrapeR.git")
```

```r
# install from Github
devtools::install_github("dashee87/betScrapeR")
```

`betScrapeR` relies on the [rvest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/rvest.pdf) and [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) packages. The former will be automatically installed with `betScrapeR`, while the latter needs to be installed manually. Similar to before, we just install it directly from the R console:


```r
# install from Gitlab
devtools::install_git("https://gitlab.com/phillc73/abettor.git")
```

```r
# install from Github
devtools::install_github("phillc73/abettor")
```

## Tutorial

Okay, so we've successfully installed `betScrapeR` and its dependent packages. Let's see it in action. First, we need to load the package. We also load `rvest` and `abettor`.

```r
# loading packages
library("betScrapeR")
library("rvest")
library("abettor")
```

We'll be performing betfair exchange API calls, so we need to login via the [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) package. A basic knowledge of the API is needed for this package, so please consult the [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) documentation if this part is unfamiliar to you.

```r
# logging in
loginBF("username","password","appkey")
```

If you're not interested in programming, you can just launch the interactive app with one simple line.

```r
# launch interactive app
launch()
```

The interactive app is relatively intuitive (at least I hope it is), so we'll return our focus to more manual features of the package. Having successfully logged onto the exchange API, we can look up the details of the upcoming horse races.

```r
# eventTypeIds: Horse Racing=7; Football/Soccer= 1; Tennis = 2;
HRaces <- listMarketCatalogue(eventTypeIds = c("7"),
fromDate = (format(Sys.time()+60*60, "%Y-%m-%dT%TZ")),
marketTypeCodes = c("WIN"),marketCountries = c("GB"))
```

`HRaces` is a dataframe containg information (venue, runners names, etc) related to the upcoming British horse racing events. Note that the `fromDate` parameter means that races that are about to start will be excluded. Again, more details about these functions can be found on the [abettor](https://github.com/phillc73/abettor) documentation. Familiarise yourself with the structure of `HRaces`:

```r
 View(HRaces)
```
 
Let's focus on the next race to start from `Hraces`. Using `listMarketbook` from the `abettor` package, we could return the current price/odds for each horse in the race. By running the `horseScraper` function from  `betScrapeR`, we can combine exchange data with the corresponding odds offered by bookmakers on this race. Let's try it out:

```r
 scraped <- horseScraper(HRaces[1,])
```

We've run the function for the first race in our table of horse races and called the output of the function `scraped`. Unless an unexpected error occured, like `HRaces` before, `scraped` is a data frame. Familiarise yourself with its structure:

```r
 View(scraped)
```

Each column in `scraped` corresponds to a horse in this race. The first five rows reference exchange data, while the remaining rows consist of various bookies' odds for that horse. Please consult the `horseScraper` documentation for a more complete description of the values within this data frame.

We can play around with this data frame using some basic R operations. For example, we can return all the horses that are arbs (i.e. their lays odds are lower than the odds offered by at least one bookmaker):

```r
colnames(scraped)[which(scraped[4,]<sapply(scraped[6:nrow(scraped),],max))]
```

Or we can loop through all the races in `HRaces` and print all the arbs:

```r
for(i in 1:nrow(HRaces)){
print(paste(HRaces[i,]$event$venue,HRaces[i,]$marketStartTime))
scraped <- horseScraper(HRaces[i,])
print(colnames(scraped)[which(scraped[4,]<sapply(scraped[6:nrow(scraped),],max))])
}
```

And if we're looking for arbs with Stan James specifically with more than Â£10 available to lay at that price on the exchange, then we could adapt the code above to print these Skybet arbs:

```r
for(i in 1:nrow(HRaces)){
print(paste(HRaces[i,]$event$venue,HRaces[i,]$marketStartTime))
scraped <- horseScraper(HRaces[i,])
print(colnames(scraped)[which(scraped[4,]<scraped["Stan James",] & scraped[5,]>10)])
}
```

## Summary

This tutorial was by no means exhaustive. I've highlighted just one way you could harness `betScrapeR` (i.e. to identify horse racing arbs). Alternatively, the data frame returned from the `horseScraper` function could be utilised for more general trading strategies (e.g. to identify horses that are drifting/shortening at the bookies). How you use it is up to you. If you've had any issues/difficulties with this tutorial, then please do let me know [here](https://github.com/dashee87/betScrapeR/issues).
