\description{
\code{partialMatch} converts betting odds from fraction to decimal. By
default, Oddschecker provides odds as fractions, while the exchange utilise
decimal odds. To allow easier comparision, we need to convert the fractional
odds to decimal. The function also returns negative under specific scenarios
(e.g. no odds).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

# 2.25 is the decimal form of "5/4"

fracToDec("5/4")

# We can map a vector of fractional odds to their decimal form equivalent

sapply(c("5/4","8/11","4/6","5","22/2"),fracToDec)

# Finally, sometimes the odds are not provided, or at least not in fractional form.
To account for this, specific numbers are returned.

sapply(c("EVS","SP",""),fracToDec)
